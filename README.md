# vid

## Name

`vid` is derived from the shortest unambiguous abbreviation for the missing pdb command "visual"

## Features

### Live

vid always shows *live* source code, not static text.

For some languages, initially targetting `python` and `bash`, vid allows live editing of the source as well.
So, if you are paused at line 15 you can edit line 16, then step into line 16.

### Reload



###`vim` like
 
If you know `vim` you won't be surprised by the directions that the `j`, `k`, `w`, `b`, ... keys move in vid.

But if you need a **real** editor for text switch back to vim.
